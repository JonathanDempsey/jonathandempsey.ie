						<p class="paragraph">The project was worked on as part of a team of two throughout the 
							entire college year. Learning to work cohesively as part of a team was an extremely useful skill to learn from the 
							project. Building the project required many new skills to be learned, and old skills to be improved upon. When the 
							idea for Keep Them Safe was just a concept, research had to be carried out to determine the technologies that would 
							need to be used in the project. 
							<br>
							</br>
							After extensive research, it was decided that building on the knowledge of PHP and MySQL 
							databases that were learned in second year would be an ideal route to take to accomplish
							the projects goals. As the project was to be completed over the course of the year, weekly 
							and bi-weekly deadlines had to be met. With these deadlines, in addition to multiple other 
							projects that were worked on throughout the year, time management was a skill that had to be 
							learned.
